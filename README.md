# Introduction

This repository serves as my study on procedural generation.
I plan to work on:

## Noise

    - value noise
    - gradient noise
    - domain warping

## Cellular & local-rule systems

    - cellular automata
    - cave generation
    - reaction-diffusion (Gray-Scott)
    - flood fill & region labeling
    - erosion

## Graphs

    - BSP dungeon generation
    - Voronoi diagrams
    - Delaunay triangulation
    - Random walks
    - Maze generation

## Constraint solving & symbolic generation

    - wave function collapse
    - grammar-based generation
    - shape grammars

As of now, only trivial 1D value noise has been implemented.
